# Ultimate salmon and steamed rice

Salmon, tenderstem broccoli, baby sweetcorn, lightly pickled grated carrot, toasted nuts, and an optional fried egg, served on a bed of steamed rice. I've tried all sorts of variations on this recipe, and this is by far my favourite.

**Serves:** quantities as written will serve two hungry people, but this recipe is easily scaled up or down.

## Ingredients:

- 500g boneless salmon fillets, skin on (usually two small fillets per ~250g pack)
- Rice of your choosing, see note below.
- 200g tenderstem broccoli
- 130g baby sweetcorn
- 2 carrots
- 2-3 spring onions (also known as "green onions" or "scallions")
- A small handful of (unshelled) plain unsalted peanuts or cashew nuts
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 2cm of ginger, peeled
- 1-2tsp chili flake
- 2 red Serrano chilies (sold in the UK as "red chilies")
- 2 eggs (optional)
- Sesame seeds
- 2tsp honey (optional)
- 1/2tsp lemongrass paste (optional)
- 3tbsp lemon juice
- 1tbsp + 2tsp rice vinegar
- 1tbsp mirin
- Light soy sauce
- 1tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1tbsp sunflower oil

The type and quantity of rice you choose is very much up to you. Jasmine long-grain, Japanese uruchimai short-grain, and Chinese black rice are my favourite varieties that work well here. A rough rule is that rice will triple in weight when cooked.

### Tools needed:

- Cast iron pan
- Large pan lid (big enough to cover cast iron pan)
- Frying pan
- Rice steamer
- Microwave
- Microwavable jug or bowl
- Grater
- Peeler
- Garlic crusher
- Metal spatula

If you don't have a rice steamer, you can use a stovetop method to steam your rice. There are lots of tutorials for this online.

The cast iron pan is technically optional. You could replace it with any heavy flat-bottomed frying pan if you don't have cast iron. The main benefit of cast iron is that it maintains its temperature when you add food to it, due to its large thermal mass.

## A note on rice

The cooking time for this recipe depends largely on the type of rice you're using and the method you use to cook it. Black rice, for example, takes significantly longer to cook from dry than white rice. Adjust your timings accordingly.

Properly steamed rice is vastly superior in texture and flavour to boiled. Rice cooker appliances used to be a very expensive imported luxury in the UK, with Japanese imports costing almost ten times their RRP, but retail availability has skyrocketed in recent years, leading to a price crash - you can now pick up a basic model for under £20, or a more flexible multi-cooker type for around £60. I can honestly say that my rice cooker is one of the best value for money appliances I've ever purchased.

Aside from the positive impact on the food itself, proper rice cookers have a very useful feature: once the rice is cooked they switch into a "keep warm" mode that keeps your rice in a safe temperature range, without cooking it any further, until you're ready to serve it. This takes a lot of the guess-work out of the timings. Start your rice early and it'll be sat waiting when the rest of your meal is cooked.

## Method

Rinse your rice thoroughly. My usual method is to put it in an oversized bowl and repeatedly fill and drain it until the water runs nearly clear. This usually takes five or more washing cycles. You may also, optionally, pre-soak your rice in water for 30 minutes before cooking. This helps hydrate the rice and remove more starch, resulting in fluffier rice that doesn't stick together as much. With black rice the soaking step may not be optional. Refer to the instructions for your particular rice.

#### Preparation

Peel the carrots. Dice one, grate the other. Mix 1tsp rice vinegar or white wine vinegar with 2-3tbsp of water and add it to the grated carrot, tossing to ensure even coating. Leave it to lightly pickle while you cook the rest of the meal.

Trim the very end (around 1cm) off the tenderstem broccoli stalks, then chop them in two lengthways, giving you two flat sides.

Take the peanuts or cashew nuts and hit them with a hard object like the bottom-side of a pan or mug, until they break into halves. You can also chop them a little finer if you prefer smaller pieces.

Cut the chilies in two, remove the seeds (not for heat - they can be quite bitter), and finely dice them.

Chop the baby sweetcorn into bite-size pieces. The exact size is up to you, but I usually go for 2cm pieces. Place it in a microwave-safe jug or bowl along with a splash of water.

Finely slice the spring onions. They look great if you slice them at a 45 degree angle.

Mix 1tbsp lemon juice with 6tbsp water, in a glass or mug.

If your salmon fillets aren't already in two pieces per person, cut them up. This ensures that there's enough surface area exposed to heat for them to cook through without becoming dry.

Peel and crush one of the cloves of garlic. Add this, along with the diced carrot, to the uncooked rice. Add a teaspoon of rice vinegar, one tablespoon of mirin, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and one tablespoon of light soy sauce to the water. Optionally, add a teaspoon of chili flake. Still well. Start the rice steaming whenever your timings line up. Don't worry about there only being one clove of garlic in this part - there's plenty more to come later.

#### Salmon

Heat up your cast iron pan until ripping hot. Salt the salmon fillets, particularly on the skin-side. Add a small splash of sunflower oil to the pan just before adding the salmon, skin-side down. Place the pan lid on top. Cook for 4 minutes on high heat, moving the fillets once with a spatula after the first minute to prevent them from sticking. Try to put the pan lid back on as quickly as possible.

After the first 4 minutes, turn the heat off and flip the salmon over to the non-skin side, again replacing the pan lid. Cook for just one minute before flipping it back onto the skin side. Add the lemon juice and water mixture to the edge of the pan, away from the fish, and quickly cover with the pan lid. The salmon will finish steaming with the latent heat and humidity. Do not remove the lid - this will let all the heat out. If your fillets are large, or you think they need more time, you can turn the heat on low and add more water as needed. Try to ensure that the water turns to steam quickly upon hitting the pan, so that you don't flood the skin with water.

You can carefully separate the flakes of salmon to check that it is cooked through to the center. If you mess up the timings and the salmon is undercooked, don't panic. Just microwave it for a minute. The skin will lose a little of its crispiness but it'll still be good.

#### Broccoli

Peel and finely chop the remaining three cloves of garlic. Grate the ginger, using a microplane if you have one. Heat the frying pan over high heat and add 1tbsp of sesame oil until shimmering and starting to smoke. Add half of the diced chili, 1tsp of chili flake, the crushed garlic, and grated ginger to the pan. Let it cook for 30 seconds. Add the nuts and tenderstem broccoli to the pan and cook for around 2-3 minutes, stirring and tossing frequently. Add 1tbsp soy sauce, 1btsp rice vinegar, and 2tsp honey (optional) to the pan. Toss the broccoli in this mixture and cook for an additional minute or two.

If you're including the fried eggs, add a little extra splash of sesame oil to the same pan as the broccoli and fry the eggs at the same time. Season them with a little salt and cracked black pepper during cooking.

#### Finishing up

Microwave the baby sweetcorn for roughly two minutes (based on an 800W microwave). Drain all but around 1tbsp of water from the jug. Add the 1/2tsp of lemongrass paste to this water, if you're including it. Mix this into the cooked rice and let it sit for a minute.

Drain any excess liquid from the grated carrot.

Serve the rice into two warm bowls. Add the tenderstem broccoli and nuts on top. Optionally add a splash of soy sauce, but be careful not to over-salt the dish. Carefully place the salmon on top. Add the grated carrot to one side. If you made eggs, add the fried egg to the other side. Garnish with the spring onion and the remainder of the diced chili, along with an optional additional pinch of chili flake. Sprinkle over some sesame seeds and some freshly ground black pepper.

Enjoy.
