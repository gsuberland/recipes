* 2 tsp hot paprika
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 pinch chili flakes (or more, to taste)
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* olive oil

### Tools needed:

* Mixing bowl
* Frying pan
* Large sauce pan
* Wooden spoon
* Tongs
* Garlic crusher
* Julienne peeler

## Method

Chop the herbs as per the ingredients list.

Add around 1 tbsp of olive oil to a large sauce pan and bring up to medium heat. Peel and crush the garlic, then add it to the pan and let it cook for a little under a minute, stirring continuously, until you begin to see it beginning to go golden at the edges. Turn the heat to low and add the tinned tomatoes, the oregano, paprika, cayenne, chili flakes, and add just a pinch of the sage. Stir to combine and leave to simmer on low.

Dice the red pepper and the mushrooms. Chop the sundried tomatoes into small pieces. Add a small amount of olive oil to the frying pan, bring it up to medium heat, then fry the vegetables in it for around 5 minutes. Once they have softened, add them to the sauce pan.

In a bowl, mix the beef mince, pesto, honey, and the remainder of the sage, until everything is evenly distributed. Press everything together into a large ball and repeatedly split it in two until you have 16 equally sized meatballs. They should come out at around an inch and a half (3.5cm) in diameter, but the size isn't critical.

Add a teaspoon of olive oil back to the frying pan and bring it up to medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and fry for around 7-8 minutes, turning occasionally with the tongs. Keep a careful eye on them as the sugar from the honey can burn if left unchecked - you can always drop the heat a little if you find they're starting to darken too quickly. They should come out golden brown on the outside.

Once browned, add the meatballs to the sauce, along with as much of the accumulated fat from the pan as you wish. If the sauce has thickened too much, add a little water. Stir in the chopped basil and the balsamic vinegar. Leave to simmer on low heat so the meatballs finish cooking through.

Using the julienne peeler, make long thin strips of courgetti. With each cut try to get about half and half green and white, and keep going until you're reaching the inner part of the courgette where the seeds are. You can either blanche these in boiling water, or fry them in the frying pan, depending on how healthy you're trying to be. Either way they shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.

Serve in warm bowls.
