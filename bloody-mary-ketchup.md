The best ketchup you'll ever try in your life. Truly incredible with fries or on burgers.

I came across the concept of Bloody Mary Ketchup many years ago after ordering a meal at The Craft Beer Co in London. They had a bottle of the stuff, made by a local company (near Camden, I think?), and I set out to make my own. Turns out it's remarkably simple.

## Ingredients:

* Tomato ketchup (Heinz, ideally)
* Black pepper
* Vodka (cheap stuff is fine)

### Tools needed:

* Small bowl to mix the ketchup in

## Method

Squirt a bunch of ketchup into a small bowl.

Add a bunch of black pepper, to taste. You _can_ use fresh cracked black pepper, but texture ends up a bit gritty, so I recommend the pre-ground powder stuff. I usually add about a heaped teaspoon or two of the fine pre-ground stuff, but I'm a hardcore black pepper addict so tweak the amounts to your own preferences. Don't stir just yet!

Add a splash of vodka. I usually go by eye, just measuring with the bottle cap - maybe 5% by total volume of ketchup. Enough to be useful, not so much that you make the ketchup go runny. Now's the time to stir!

The vodka seems to act like a solvent for the piperine in the pepper and really brings it out with a punch. It really ends up being greater than the sum of its parts.
