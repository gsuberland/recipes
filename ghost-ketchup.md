Tomato ketchup with ghost peppers. It's spicy.

## Ingredients:

* 50g of ghost peppers
* 200g of tomato paste
* 80ml white vinegar
* 80ml corn syrup
* 3tsp white sugar
* 2-5tsp freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
* 1tsp kosher salt
* 1tsp oregano
* 1/2tsp onion powder (not flakes)
* 1/2tsp garlic powder (not flakes)
* 1tsp Worcestershire sauce (optional)

### Tools needed:

* Gloves
* Large bowl
* Coffee mug
* Seive
* Hand blender
* Saucepan
* Kettle (unless you're American and need to boil water on a stove like it's 1864)

## Method

Put on gloves. Chop up the ghost peppers into thin ribbons and remove, but do not discard, the seeds.

Put the seeds into the mug and add just enough boiling water to cover or suspend the seeds.

Put the chopped peppers into the bowl. A ceramic or glass bowl is better than a metal one as it retains heat better. Add enough boiling water to achieve partial coverage - we want the peppers to soften but too much water will lead to a watery ketchup.

Wait around five minutes for the peppers to soften, then strain the liquid from the mug into the bowl. Throw away the seeds.

Carefully blend the peppers into a paste. Keep your gloves on, and you may want eye protection. Getting a splash of ghost pepper in your eye is not a fun experience. Nor anywhere else for that matter.

Pour the pepper paste into a pan over medium heat and add the remainder of the ingredients, stirring well to combine.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the sugars from burning on the bottom of the pan.

When done, the mixture should have a consistency like a particularly runny ketchup. Cover the pan and let it cool to room temperature. Once done, pour into a bottle and refridgerate.
