Mushroom peppercorn sauce. The two combined are better than the sum of their parts. I came up with this one day when I couldn't decide between doing a peppercorn sauce or a mushroom sauce for some ostrich steaks.

It goes without saying that this stuff is amazing on steak, but it can also be made vegetarian to go with grilled portabello mushrooms or a halloumi burger.

## Ingredients:

* 2tbsp butter (salted or unsalted, doesn't matter)
* splash of olive oil
* 2 large shallots
* 3-5tbsp whole peppercorns (any variety you like)
* 3-5tbsp brandy
* 100ml red wine (optional)
* 1tbsp soy sauce
* 250ml strong beef stock (see notes below)
* 5tbsp double cream
* mushrooms (see notes below)
* pinch of thyme
* pinch of sage
* pinch of MSG (optional)

### Ingredient notes

The peppercorns you use will make a lot of difference toward the final flavour. Black peppercorns are bold and powerful, and I'm personally a huge fan. Green peppercorns are much lighter and tend to come pre-soaked in brine. They're a staple of restaurant peppercorn sauces because they're softer, thus taking less time to cook, plus they're unlikely to offend anyone who is more sensitive to piperine than the average diner. White and red/pink peppercorns are a varied bunch and if you're using these then you probably already have an idea of what you're going for. I personally tend to go for black peppercorns, then grind over some freshly cracked mixed peppercorns to broaden the flavours a little.

For the beef stock you want it nice and strong. It should be bold enough in flavour that your face almost starts to contort when you taste it on its own. If you're using real liquid beef stock, consider pre-reducing it until you get the desired effect, then measure 250ml from that. If you're like me and don't tend to have proper beef stock to hand, I've found that two Oxo beef stock cubes in 250ml of hot (but not boiling) water produces the right strength. Meat-free beef stock cubes are available if you're making a vegetarian version.

The red wine is optional. It helps to deepen the earthiness while also providing a hint of acidity. Merlot or Malbec are ideal. If you're not using wine, make 300ml of stock instead of 250ml.

For mushrooms you can use pretty much anything. Button, chestnut, portabello, whatever. I recently made this recipe and forgot to buy fresh mushrooms, so I crumbled a bunch of dried shitake mushrooms in that I usually use for ramen. Worked fine. They're mostly there for texture and umami. The exact quantity is up to you. I tend to eyeball it so I've got about as much diced mushroom as I have diced shallot, in roughly equal sized chunks.

MSG is optional, but recommended. It has some major flavour benefits over plain salt. Tread lightly if you've already seasoned your steak with MSG.

### Tools needed:

* Saucepan or high-sided frying pan
* Wooden spoon
* Mortar and pestle (optional)

## Method

First, decide how strong you want your sauce to be. 3tbsp of peppercorns is a nice baseline, 5tbsp for a bolder flavour that better suits fans of piperine.

If you're using dry black peppercorns, I like to smash a little over half of them with a mortal and pestle first. Just smash them enough to get them broken up a bit.

If you've got the time, pre-soak the peppercorns in the fridge using as little water as needed to cover them. Anywhere from an hour to overnight. This is 100% optional and is only really done as a safety method to reduce the chances of biting into a hard part-cooked peppercorn later.

Peel and finely chop the shallots. Dice the mushrooms into small pieces. As I mentioned above, I like to have roughly equal amounts of mushroom and shallot.

Put the pan over low heat and melt the butter. Once it is just starting to foam slightly, add the shallots, mushrooms, peppercorns, and a splash of olive oil. If you're cracking in any additional fancy peppercorns, now's the time. Optionally, add a pinch of salt to help extract the water from the mushrooms.

Increase heat to medium. Cook for around 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn soft and translucent. Do not brown the shallots. It's better to cook for longer at a lower heat than to overdo it.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the brandy to the pan - 1tbsp per tbsp of peppercorns you used. Continue to cook, stirring continuously, until the brandy has almost disappeared, leaving the shallots slightly sticky.

Add the wine and soy sauce. If you're not using wine, mix the extra 50ml of stock with 50ml of water and use that in its place. Turn the heat up and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Cook until the volume of liquid is reduced by around half.

Add the stock, thyme, and sage. Continue to cook on high until it has reduced in volume by about two thirds. As it reduces you'll want to stir more frequently. The timing on this part varies a lot - anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

Turn off the heat and leave the sauce to rest and cool for 1-2 minutes. Stir in the cream. Taste for seasoning. If it needs a little salt, ideally use MSG instead. Don't be afraid to add more freshly ground black pepper in. It's all up to you.

If you need to keep the sauce warm while you complete other parts of your meal, you can do so on the smallest burner of a gas hob set as low as it can go. Stir frequently to prevent a skin forming on top. Do not try this with an electric hob - they work by turning the heat to 100% and then back to 0% on a variable duty cycle, which will likely cause the sauce to burn or split.

If you're particular about textures, or if you've discovered that your peppercorns didn't cook all the way through, you can strain the sauce before serving. Ideally, though, you should leave it as-is and serve it with all of the mushroom, onion, and peppercorns included.
