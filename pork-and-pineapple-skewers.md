Pork, pineapple, and bell pepper grilled on a skewer, with a sweet and spicy pineapple glaze.

**Serves:** at least two people, if served with a side salad

## Ingredients:

* 1kg diced pork
* 500g tinned pineapple chunks in juice (or a fresh pineapple and a carton of pineapple juice)
* One or two bell peppers
* 2 tbsp jerk spice
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp cayenne pepper powder
* 4 tbsp tomato ketchup
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tsp white vinegar
* 2 tbsp brown sugar

### Tools needed:

* Mixing bowl
* Plastic wrap
* Small saucepan
* Basting brush
* Skewers (wood or metal is fine)
* Grill, broiler, or BBQ

## Method

Place the raw diced pork into a bowl along with the jerk spice, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Pour over the pineapple juice. There should be enough to just cover all the meat - if not, top up with water or pineapple juice from a carton.

Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least one hour.

Chop up the bell peppers into pieces that are about the same dimensions as your pork. If you're using fresh pineapple now's the time to chop it up into chunks too.

Take the pork out and pour the liquid into the pan. Add the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar. Stir well, then simmer for around ten to fifteen minutes until it is hot and reduced to a gravy-like consistency.

While the sauce is reducing, construct the skewers from alternating pieces of pork, pineapple, and pepper. When the sauce is thickened sufficiently, baste it onto the skewers.

Cook the skewers for approximately 15 minutes on medium heat, turning occasionally and basting with more sauce. Turn up the heat towards the end to brown everything, and get some char if you're into that.
